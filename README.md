## Core Components

### Communication Layer
- **LoRa Sender**: Handles message transmission with compressed payload encoding
- **LoRa Receiver**: Manages incoming LoRa communications with memory-optimized decoding
- **Message Protocol**: Standardized communication format with 4 message types (DATA, CONFIG, THRESHOLDS, SENDFAIL)
- **Config Manager**: Manages LoRa parameters and sensor thresholds with validation

### Node Hierarchy
- **Local Nodes**: Direct sensor interface with DHT11 and soil moisture sensors
- **Sublocal Nodes**: Intermediate data aggregation and routing (planned)
- **Central Node**: Main control center for system coordination (planned)

### Data Management
- **Data Collector**: Sensor data acquisition with hardware abstraction
- **Alert System**: Advanced 16-bit bitfield system with agricultural context-aware colors
- **Memory Optimization**: Reference-based parameter passing to minimize memory usage

## Features
