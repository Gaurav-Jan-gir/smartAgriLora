# smartAgriLora
This Repository contains the source code and documentation for a Smart Agriculture Monitoring System which utilizes resources efficiently with LoRa communication system.

## Project Overview
The Smart Agriculture Monitoring System is designed to efficiently monitor agricultural parameters using LoRa (Long Range) communication technology. The system consists of multiple nodes organized in a hierarchical structure to collect, process, and transmit agricultural data.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Components
- **data_alert.cpp** - Alert system for agricultural data monitoring
- **data_collector.cpp** - Data collection module for sensor readings
- **lora_receiver.cpp** - LoRa receiver implementation for data reception

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- **lora_sender.cpp** - LoRa sender implementation for data transmission
- **lora_receiver.cpp** - Updates and improvements to existing receiver

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Implementation
- **local_node.cpp** - Local node implementation utilizing LoRa sender/receiver
- **sublocal_node.cpp** - Sublocal node for intermediate data processing
- **central_node.cpp** - Central node for data aggregation and control

## System Architecture
The system follows a hierarchical communication structure:
```
Central Node
    â†“
Sublocal Nodes
    â†“
Local Nodes
    â†“
Sensors/Actuators
```

## Core Components

### Communication Layer
- **LoRa Sender**: Handles message transmission with LoRa object parameter
- **LoRa Receiver**: Manages incoming LoRa communications
- **Message Protocol**: Standardized communication format between nodes

### Node Hierarchy
- **Local Nodes**: Direct sensor interface and basic data processing
- **Sublocal Nodes**: Intermediate data aggregation and routing
- **Central Node**: Main control center for system coordination

### Data Management
- **Data Collector**: Sensor data acquisition and preprocessing
- **Data Alert**: Alert system for critical conditions and thresholds

## Features
- Long-range communication using LoRa technology
- Hierarchical node structure for scalable deployment
- Efficient resource utilization
- Real-time agricultural monitoring
- Alert system for critical conditions
