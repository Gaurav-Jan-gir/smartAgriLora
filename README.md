# smartAgriLora
This Repository contains the source code and documentation for a Smart Agriculture Monitoring System which utilizes resources efficiently with LoRa communication system.

## Project Overview
The Smart Agriculture Monitoring System is designed to efficiently monitor agricultural parameters using LoRa (Long Range) communication technology. The system consists of multiple nodes organized in a hierarchical structure to collect, process, and transmit agricultural data.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components
- **data__alert.cpp** - Advanced 16-bit bitfield alert system with 25 unique colors and agricultural combinations
- **data_collector.cpp** - Optimized data collection module for sensor readings (DHT11 + soil moisture)
- **lora_receiver.cpp** - LoRa receiver implementation with memory-optimized decode functions
- **lora_sender.cpp** - LoRa sender implementation for data transmission with compressed payloads
- **config_manager.cpp** - Configuration management with India-compliant 865MHz frequency
- **local_node.cpp** - Local node implementation with sensor integration and LoRa communication
- **Header files** - Complete struct definitions and class interfaces for all components

### � In Progress
- **System integration testing** - Validation of complete communication chain

- **Config Manager**: Manages LoRa parameters and sensor thresholds with validation

### Node Hierarchy
- **Local Nodes**: Direct sensor interface with DHT11 and soil moisture sensors
- **Sublocal Nodes**: Intermediate data aggregation and routing (planned)
- **Central Node**: Main control center for system coordination (planned)

### Data Management
- **Data Collector**: Sensor data acquisition with hardware abstraction
- **Alert System**: Advanced 16-bit bitfield system with agricultural context-aware colors
- **Memory Optimization**: Reference-based parameter passing to minimize memory usage

## Features
- **Long-range communication** using LoRa technology (865MHz for India compliance)
- **Hierarchical node structure** for scalable deployment
- **Memory-optimized code** with reference-based parameter passing
- **Compressed data transmission** for efficient bandwidth usage
- **Real-time agricultural monitoring** with DHT11 and soil moisture sensors
- **Advanced alert system** with 16-bit bitfield and 25 unique colors for agricultural conditions
- **Smart color logic** - appropriate colors for seasonal conditions vs critical system alerts

- Standard Arduino libraries (Wire, SPI)

## Technical Specifications

### Communication Protocol
- **Frequency**: 865MHz (India ISM band compliant)
- **Modulation**: LoRa with configurable SF7-SF12
- **Bandwidth**: 125kHz standard, adjustable for range optimization
- **Message Types**: DATA, CONFIG, THRESHOLDS, SENDFAIL
- **Payload Compression**: 32-bit compressed sensor data transmission

### Sensor Support
- **Temperature**: DHT11 (-40°C to +80°C, ±2°C accuracy)
- **Humidity**: DHT11 (5% to 95% RH, ±5% accuracy)
- **Soil Moisture**: Analog sensor with 10-bit ADC (0-1023 raw values)

### Alert System
- **16-bit Bitfield**: Efficient alert representation with bitwise operations
- **25 Unique Colors**: Context-aware colors for agricultural and system conditions
- **Agricultural Combinations**: Predefined colors for seasonal conditions (summer heat, drought, etc.)
- **Priority System**: Critical system alerts override normal environmental conditions
- **Memory Efficient**: PROGMEM storage for static data, buffer-based functions

### Memory Optimization
- Reference-based parameter passing eliminates unnecessary object copying
- Compressed payload reduces transmission bandwidth
- PROGMEM usage for static data (alert descriptions and colors)
